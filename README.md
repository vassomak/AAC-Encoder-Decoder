# AAC-encoder-decoder
This is an assignment of the course Multimedia Systems (AUTh-9th semester).

The goal is to implement an AAC Encoder and Decoder. The phychoacoustic model is used as conformity criterionn for the quantizer, the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) at the filterbank level, and Huffman encoding for entropy encoding. 
Level 1 is the simplest implementation, and more modules are added in each level.

A schematic of the encoder and the decoder is displayed below:
